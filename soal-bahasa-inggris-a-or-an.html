                                            berikut ini adalah soal  dalam bahasa inggris.
The digital age
we are now living in what some people call the digital age, meaning that computers have become an essential part of our lives. young people who grown up with PCs and mobile phones are called the digital generation. computers help students to perform mathematical operations and improve math skills. they are used to access the internet, to do basic research and to communicate with other students around the world. teachers use projectors and interactive whiteboards to give presentations and teach sciences, history or language courses. PCs are also used for administrative purposes-schools use word processors to write letters, and databases to keep records of students and teachers. a school website allows teachers to publish exercises for students  to complete online. students can also enroll for courses via the website and parents can download official reports.
mobiles let you make voice calls, send texts, email people and download logos, ringtones or games. with a built-in camera you can send pictures and make video calls in face-to-face mode. new smartphones combine a telephone with web access, video, a game console, an MP3 player, a personal digital assistant (PDA) and a GPS navigation system, all in one.
in banks, computers store information about the money held by each costumer and enable staff to access large databases and try to carry out financial transactions at high speed. they also control the cashpoints, or ATMs (automatic teller machines), which dispense money to costumers by the use of a PIN protection card. people use a Chip and PIN card to pay goods and services. instead of using a signature to verify payments, costumers are asked to enter a four-digit personal identification number (PIN), the same number used at cashpoints; this system makes transactions more secure. with online banking, clients can easily pay bills and transfer money from the comfort of their homes.
airplane pilots use computers to help them control the plane. for example, monitors display data about fuel consumption and weather conditions. in airport control towers, computers are used to manage radar systems and regulate air traffic. on the ground, airlines are connected to travel agencies by computer. travel agents use computers to find out about the availability of flight, prices, times, stopovers and the other details.

Polar bears have a strong navigational sense and an extremely good sense of smell, and they are unusually clever at solving problems in order to obtain food. Since they are carnivores; they eat primarily finged seals, and occasionally bearded seals, walruses, or white whales. They also feed on berries, sedges, mussels, and kelp.
They live in pack ice where water is accessible. They can be found throughout Arctic regions.
Except during the breeding season, male polar bears are solitary and roam over vast expanses of sea ice while hunting. During the breeding season (May to June), the males fight furiously over females. Both the male and female may mate with other individuals as well. The female typically gives birth o two cubs after a four- to- five- month gestation period. Cubs remain with the mother for about 28 months, often nursing the entire time. The young are very small when born: about 1 kg (about 2 lb). Their eyes remain closed for about 40 days and they must nurse every few hours. The mother holds them close to keep them warm.</a>

One of the best tourist attractions of this province is Tanjung Setia Beach. This beach is located in the village of Tanjung Setia, West Lampung district, Lampung province. It is about 273 km or about six to seven hour driving from Bandar Lampung, the capital city of Lampung province. This beach has not been well known by the citizens of Indonesia yet, but for the world surfers this beach is a hidden paradise for surfing. This beach is exactly laid on the track of large Indian Ocean currents that make this beach have waves which are quite perfect for surfing. The perfect wave of this beach usually lasts from June to August with the height which can reach up to six to seven meters with a 200 meters length. In addition to perfect waves for surfing, the beach also has an ambience which is quite natural with white sand along the beach. Rows of palm tree which grow also adorn this beach. For local people, the beach area is also an ideal place for fishing. Some fish which are often obtained by the fisherman are blue marlin which is so big enough that its weight can reach up to 70 kilograms.

Almost everyone eats bread daily, especially for breakfast. Bread making is not a complicated task. You onlyneed flour, water, yeast, sugar, salt, oil, butter, and an oven. Choosing good flour is the step in making bread.There are two kinds of flour, soft and hard.

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</a>

                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.
 The paragraph following the above most likely discusses ...  
A.	Children’s vast imagination
B.	The privacy of make-believe world of children
C.	Adult’s resentful reaction toward children’s imagination
D.	Examples of games which may be taken as reality by children
E.	How to restrict children’s imagination</a>

Polar bears have a strong navigational sense and an extremely good sense of smell, and they are unusually clever at solving problems in order to obtain food. Since they are carnivores; they eat primarily finged seals, and occasionally bearded seals, walruses, or white whales. They also feed on berries, sedges, mussels, and kelp.
They live in pack ice where water is accessible. They can be found throughout Arctic regions.
Except during the breeding season, male polar bears are solitary and roam over vast expanses of sea ice while hunting. During the breeding season (May to June), the males fight furiously over females. Both the male and female may mate with other individuals as well. The female typically  gives birth o two cubs after a four- to- five- month gestation period. Cubs remain with the mother for about 28 months, often nursing the entire time. The young are very small when born: about 1 kg (about 2 lb). Their eyes remain closed for about 40 days and they must nurse every few hours. The mother holds them close to keep them warm.</a>

                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.

                            4. berikut ini adalah soal  dalam bahasa inggris.
The digital age
we are now living in what some people call the digital age, meaning that computers have become an essential part of our lives. young people who grown up with PCs and mobile phones are called the digital generation. computers help students to perform mathematical operations and improve math skills. they are used to access the internet, to do basic research and to communicate with other students around the world. teachers use projectors and interactive whiteboards to give presentations and teach sciences, history or language courses. PCs are also used for administrative purposes-schools use word processors to write letters, and databases to keep records of students and teachers. a school website allows teachers to publish exercises for students  to complete online. students can also enroll for courses via the website and parents can download official reports.
mobiles let you make voice calls, send texts, email people and download logos, ringtones or games. with a built-in camera you can send pictures and make video calls in face-to-face mode. new smartphones combine a telephone with web access, video, a game console, an MP3 player, a personal digital assistant (PDA) and a GPS navigation system, all in one.
in banks, computers store information about the money held by each costumer and enable staff to access large databases and try to carry out financial transactions at high speed. they also control the cashpoints, or ATMs (automatic teller machines), which dispense money to costumers by the use of a PIN protection card. people use a Chip and PIN card to pay goods and services. instead of using a signature to verify payments, costumers are asked to enter a four-digit personal identification number (PIN), the same number used at cashpoints; this system makes transactions more secure. with online banking, clients can easily pay bills and transfer money from the comfort of their homes.
airplane pilots use computers to help them control the plane. for example, monitors display data about fuel consumption and weather conditions. in airport control towers, computers are used to manage radar systems and regulate air traffic. on the ground, airlines are connected to travel agencies by computer. travel agents use computers to find out about the availability of flight, prices, times, stopovers and the other details.

Polar bears have a strong navigational sense and an extremely good sense of smell, and they are unusually clever at solving problems in order to obtain food. Since they are carnivores; they eat primarily finged seals, and occasionally bearded seals, walruses, or white whales. They also feed on berries, sedges, mussels, and kelp.
They live in pack ice where water is accessible. They can be found throughout Arctic regions.
Except during the breeding season, male polar bears are solitary and roam over vast expanses of sea ice while hunting. During the breeding season (May to June), the males fight furiously over females. Both the male and female may mate with other individuals as well. The female typically gives birth o two cubs after a four- to- five- month gestation period. Cubs remain with the mother for about 28 months, often nursing the entire time. The young are very small when born: about 1 kg (about 2 lb). Their eyes remain closed for about 40 days and they must nurse every few hours. The mother holds them close to keep them warm.</h2><br />

Karena mereka adalah karnivora; mereka makan segel terutama finged, dan kadang-kadang segel berjanggut, walrus, atau paus putih. Mereka juga memakan buah, daun, kerang, dan rumput laut. <br />Mereka tinggal di es di mana air dapat diakses. Mereka dapat ditemukan di seluruh wilayah Arktik. <br />Kecuali selama musim kawin, beruang kutub jantan soliter dan berkeliaran di hamparan luas laut es sambil berburu. Selama musim kawin (Mei-Juni), laki-laki melawan mati-matian lebih dari perempuan. Baik pria dan wanita bisa kawin dengan orang lain juga. Betina biasanya melahirkan o dua anaknya setelah empat untuk- lima periode kehamilan bulan. Cubs tetap dengan ibu selama sekitar 28 bulan, sering menyusui sepanjang waktu. Orang muda sangat kecil ketika lahir: sekitar 1 kg (sekitar £ 2). Mata mereka tetap tertutup selama sekitar 40 hari dan mereka harus menyusui setiap beberapa jam.

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</h2><br />

                            20. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.
 The paragraph following the above most likely discusses ...  
A.	Children’s vast imagination
B.	The privacy of make-believe world of children
C.	Adult’s resentful reaction toward children’s imagination
D.	Examples of games which may be taken as reality by children
E.	How to restrict children’s imagination</h2><br />

Oleh karena itu, paragraf selanjutnya akan berkisar dengan hal yang sama (children vast imagination)<br /><br /><strong>Jawaban: A</strong><br />

Polar bears have a strong navigational sense and an extremely good sense of smell, and they are unusually clever at solving problems in order to obtain food. Since they are carnivores; they eat primarily finged seals, and occasionally bearded seals, walruses, or white whales. They also feed on berries, sedges, mussels, and kelp.
They live in pack ice where water is accessible. They can be found throughout Arctic regions.
Except during the breeding season, male polar bears are solitary and roam over vast expanses of sea ice while hunting. During the breeding season (May to June), the males fight furiously over females. Both the male and female may mate with other individuals as well. The female typically  gives birth o two cubs after a four- to- five- month gestation period. Cubs remain with the mother for about 28 months, often nursing the entire time. The young are very small when born: about 1 kg (about 2 lb). Their eyes remain closed for about 40 days and they must nurse every few hours. The mother holds them close to keep them warm.</h2><br />
                        Beruang kutub memiliki rasa navigasi yang kuat dan rasa yang sangat baik penciuman, dan mereka luar biasa pandai memecahkan masalah untuk mendapatkan makanan. Karena mereka adalah karnivora; mereka makan segel terutama finged, dan kadang-kadang segel berjanggut, walrus, atau paus putih. Mereka juga memakan buah, daun, kerang, dan rumput laut. <br /><br />Mereka tinggal di es di mana air dapat diakses. Mereka dapat ditemukan di seluruh wilayah Arktik. <br /><br />Kecuali selama musim kawin, beruang kutub jantan soliter dan berkeliaran di hamparan luas laut es sambil berburu. Selama musim kawin (Mei-Juni), laki-laki melawan mati-matian lebih dari perempuan. Baik pria dan wanita bisa kawin dengan orang lain juga. Betina biasanya melahirkan o dua anaknya setelah empat untuk- lima periode kehamilan bulan. Cubs tetap dengan ibu selama sekitar 28 bulan, sering menyusui sepanjang waktu. Orang muda sangat kecil ketika lahir: sekitar 1 kg (sekitar £ 2). Mata mereka tetap tertutup selama sekitar 40 hari dan mereka harus menyusui setiap beberapa jam. Sang ibu memegang mereka dekat untuk menjaga mereka hangat.<br /><br />

                            36. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.
